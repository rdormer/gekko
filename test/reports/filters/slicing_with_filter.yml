# demonstrates the tricky, poorly thought out slice_filter.
# the filter statement on line 27 acts as a row filter for each slice, filtering out
# the rows in the slice *before* any values are computed, which is why you can't use it to
# filter on movelen or any of the other computed values. Essentially it's duplicating
# row_filter for individual slices

# TO DO: my brain was pudding here, this really needs to be revisited at some point...
